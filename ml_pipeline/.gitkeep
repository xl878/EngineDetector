# ML Pipeline Overview

This folder contains training scripts and data preparation tools for supervised learning models using vibration pattern data.

## Folder Contents:

- `train_rf.py`: Random Forest classifier training on window-averaged features (RMS, FFT peak, etc.)
- `train_lstm.py`: LSTM sequence model for detecting patterns over time
- `reshape_csv.py`: Utility script to convert flat CSV data into time-sequenced numpy arrays for LSTM input

## Suggested Workflow:

1. Export your windowed CSV from the web app
2. Use `reshape_csv.py` to prepare sequence inputs (X, y arrays)
3. Train and evaluate with:
   - `train_rf.py` for fast tree-based classification
   - `train_lstm.py` for temporal deep learning

All scripts can be extended for model saving, evaluation, and visualization.
